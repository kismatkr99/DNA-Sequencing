# DNA-Sequencing
DNA sequencing, combined with machine learning, enables genome-wide analysis and classification of DNA sequences. This approach helps understand genetic variation across species and allows comparison of human, chimpanzee, and dog genomes to identify key similarities and differences in their genetic makeup.
# DNA Sequencing Analysis Web App
This is a fully functional web application for DNA sequencing analysis. Built with HTML and CSS for the front end, it uses Flask as the web framework and Python for the core processing and logic. The project integrates sequencing data handling with user-friendly interfaces, making it easy to analyze and compare DNA sequences.
