# DNA-Sequencing
DNA sequencing, combined with machine learning, enables genome-wide analysis and classification of DNA sequences. This approach helps understand genetic variation across species and allows comparison of human, chimpanzee, and dog genomes to identify key similarities and differences in their genetic makeup.
